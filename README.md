# Learning how to interact with an API

Another installment for my blog that I'm working on.

Todo:    

  [ ] Have the code in the HTML to explain what I'm doing    
  [ ] Install a code highlighter    
  [ ] Set the page up so the user can launch the results of the code after he/she has gone through the tutorial.    

There's much more coming....
